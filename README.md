## Projects

**[Machine / Deep Learning classification and NLP analysis of emails](https://github.com/lgucrl/deep-learning-email-classification/)**  
This project builds an end-to-end pipeline in Python to **classify emails as SPAM vs. HAM (non-spam)** and then perform detailed **NLP analyses** on the resulting groups. In addition to supervised classification, it explores the **main topics** of SPAM emails, the **differences/similarities** of SPAM topics, and the **organizations mentioned** in non-spam messages.

**[Deep Learning multi-label classification of online toxic comments](https://github.com/lgucrl/deep-learning-toxic-comments-classification/)**  
This deep learning project builds a detection and classification system for **toxic comments** on social platforms: given an online comment, the model predicts whether it contains one or more types of toxicity. The classifier is implemented in **Python** using **TensorFlow/Keras** and outputs a **6-dimensional vector of binary labels** (one per toxicity category).

**[Machine Learning multi-class classification of Wikipedia articles](https://github.com/lgucrl/machine-learning-wikipedia-classification)**  
This repository contains an end-to-end **big data / NLP** pipeline with the goal of exploring English Wikipedia content and building an **automatic multi-class text classifier** able to assign each article to one of **15 thematic categories** (e.g., *Culture, Economics, Medicine, Technology, Politics, Science*) using **PySpark's Machine Learning Library (MLlib)**.
